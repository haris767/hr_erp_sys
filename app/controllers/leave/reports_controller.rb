  #Explanation:
#leave.start_date.business_days_until(leave.end_date): This calculates the business days between the start and end dates of each 
#leave request, excluding weekends and holidays.

#working_days: This dynamically calculates the number of business days in the current month, excluding weekends and any public 
#holidays defined in your initializer.

#The business_time gem will automatically exclude weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and any holidays youâ€™ve defined in the initializer.
#You can add more holidays to the BusinessTime::Config.holidays array as needed.
